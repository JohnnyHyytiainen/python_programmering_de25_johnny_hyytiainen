    "|\n",
    "Answer: Git is a way to version control your files locally. While Github is used for cloud storage and version control.\n",
    "A simple way for me to remember the differences between git/github is this: Git = local and github = not local(cloud storage)\n",
    "Github also allows multiple people to work on one and the same projects by cloning repositorys to a local machine, work on a project and then commit the changes locally and then push them to github.\n",

    "b) What is the purpose of .gitignore file?\n",
    "|\n",
    "Answer: .gitignore is a file used for things which you'd want ignored. .gitignore tells what files and folders for Git to ignore and not track. Quoted from W3Schools: \n",
    "\"The .gitignore file tells Git which files and folders to ignore (not track).\n",
    "This is useful for keeping log files, temporary files, build artifacts, or personal files out of your repository.\n",
    "Examples of files to ignore: log files, temporary files, hidden files, personal files, OS/editor files, etc.\n",
    "The .gitignore file itself is tracked by Git, so everyone using the repository ignores the same files.\"\n",
    "|\n",
    "|\n",
    "c) Why is it a good idea to work with git and github?\n",
    "|\n",
    "Answer: The previous questions (A+B) gives the answers to question C. No one wants their work to get lost because of human error\n",
